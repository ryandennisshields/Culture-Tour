    m_Localized: Saint Martin was drafted into the Roman Army at age 15, he later
      became a member of the royal cavalry guard. It was while he was campaigning
      in Gaul, as an 18-year-old tribune, stationed in Amiens, that the famous legend
      of Saint Martin and the beggar took place. As he approached the gates on garrison
      duty at Amiens that he saw the beggar, with clothes so ragged that he was practically
      naked. The beggar must have been shaking and blue from the cold, but no one
      reached out to help him. Martin, overcome with compassion, took of his mantle.
      In one quick stroke he slashed the lovely mantle in two with his sword, handed
      half to the freezing man and wrapped the remainder on his own shoulders.

    m_Localized: "Martin was a roman solider who converted to Christianity after
      an encounter with a half-naked beggar at the gate of the city of Amiens in
      northern France. Martin cut his cloak in half in order to share it with the
      beggar who that night appeared to him in a dream and revealed himself to be
      Christ. Central to St Martins cult was the relic of the remaining half of his
      cloak. It was deemed to be so important that the kind of France used it as
      a royal banner in war, and they swore sacred oaths upon in. The structure in
      which the half-cloak was preserved was referred to as Capella (\u201Clittle
      cloak\u201D), a term that came to be used widely for buildings that served
      to keep relics and from which the modern word \u2018chapel\u2019 is derived."

    m_Localized: "St Martin passed on November 8th 397 AD.  After he died, local
      citizens of the Poitou region and residents of Tours quarreled over where Martin
      would be buried. One evening, after dark, several residents of Tours carried
      Martins\u2019 body to a waiting boat on the river Loire, where teams of rowers
      ferried his body on the river of Tours where masses of people waited on the
      riverbanks to meet and pay respects.  Shrines were created in his honor; the
      shrine chapel at Tours developed into one of the most prominent and influential
      establishments in medieval France. In later times the abbey was destroyed by
      fire on several occasions and ransacked by Norman Vikings in 853 and 903. It
      burned again in 994 and was rebuilt in a 20 yearlong effort. In 1453 the remains
      of St Martin were transferred to a new reliquary."

      out, often accompanied by their parents. They carry lanterns made from either
      hollowed out sugar beets or paper. The children go from house to house, singing
      songs about Sint Maarten. In, return they receive cakes, candy or fruits from
      their generous neighbors.  These lanterns symbolize the light that guided Saint
      Martin as he shared his cloak with the beggar on the cold winter\u2019s night."

    m_Localized: 'Saint Martin is the patron saint of horses and equestrians after
      his time as a cavalry solider, he spent most of his time in the roman army
      on horseback.  The horse being a wooden rocking toy is also a nod to the work
      he did with children and the compassion he showed to others. The legend of
      the white horse on which Martin arrives and carries his first snow, arose quite
      prosaically. Over the years, people have simply noticed that the first snow
      always comes in time around St Martins Day- they linked his name with a white
      horse, symbolizing the first snowflakes. '

    m_Localized: St Martin served as a bishop at the Basilica at Tours from 371-
      however reluctantly. It is said that he tried to hide from those who wanted
      to install him as Bishop, but his hiding place was given away by the cackling
      of geese, which have been associated with the saint ever since. Other stories
      tell how the saint destroyed pagan temples and cut down sacred trees using
      his hammer. in one instance, the pagans agreed to fell their sacred fir tree,
      only if Martin would stand directly in its path. He did so and the tree miraculously
      missed him.
