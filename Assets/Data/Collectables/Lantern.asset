  ObjectText: "As dusk settles on 11th November, children aged 5 to 12 ventures out,
    often accompanied by their parents. They carry lanterns made from either hollowed
    out sugar beets or paper. The children go from house to house, singing songs
    about Sint Maarten. In, return they receive cakes, candy or fruits from their
    generous neighbors.  These lanterns symbolize the light that guided Saint Martin
    as he shared his cloak with the beggar on the cold winter\u2019s night."
