  ObjectName: Cloak
  ObjectText: "Martin was a roman solider who converted to Christianity after an
    encounter with a half-naked beggar at the gate of the city of Amiens in northern
    France. Martin cut his cloak in half in order to share it with the beggar who
    that night appeared to him in a dream and revealed himself to be Christ. Central
    to St Martins cult was the relic of the remaining half of his cloak. It was deemed
    to be so important that the kind of France used it as a royal banner in war,
    and they swore sacred oaths upon in. The structure in which the half-cloak was
    preserved was referred to as Capella (\u201Clittle cloak\u201D), a term that
    came to be used widely for buildings that served to keep relics and from which
    the modern word \u2018chapel\u2019 is derived."

  Hints:
  - This looks to be Saint Martin's Cloak.
  - Maybe try re-creating an act of Saint Martin.
