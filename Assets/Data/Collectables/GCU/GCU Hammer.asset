  ObjectName: Hammer
  ObjectText: St Martin served as a bishop at the Basilica at Tours from 371- however
    reluctantly. It is said that he tried to hide from those who wanted to install
    him as Bishop, but his hiding place was given away by the cackling of geese,
    which have been associated with the saint ever since. Other stories tell how
    the saint destroyed pagan temples and cut down sacred trees using his hammer.
    in one instance, the pagans agreed to fell their sacred fir tree, only if Martin
    would stand directly in its path. He did so and the tree miraculously missed
    him.
