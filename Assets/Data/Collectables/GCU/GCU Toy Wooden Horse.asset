  ObjectName: Toy Wooden Horse
  ObjectText: 'Saint Martin is the patron saint of horses and equestrians after his
    time as a cavalry solider, he spent most of his time in the roman army on horseback. 
    The horse being a wooden rocking toy is also a nod to the work he did with children
    and the compassion he showed to others. The legend of the white horse on which
    Martin arrives and carries his first snow, arose quite prosaically. Over the
    years, people have simply noticed that the first snow always comes in time around
    St Martins Day- they linked his name with a white horse, symbolizing the first
    snowflakes. '
