  ObjectText: Saint Martin was drafted into the Roman Army at age 15, he later became
    a member of the royal cavalry guard. It was while he was campaigning in Gaul,
    as an 18-year-old tribune, stationed in Amiens, that the famous legend of Saint
    Martin and the beggar took place. As he approached the gates on garrison duty
    at Amiens that he saw the beggar, with clothes so ragged that he was practically
    naked. The beggar must have been shaking and blue from the cold, but no one reached
    out to help him. Martin, overcome with compassion, took of his mantle. In one
    quick stroke he slashed the lovely mantle in two with his sword, handed half
    to the freezing man and wrapped the remainder on his own shoulders.
