  ObjectText: "St Martin passed on November 8th 397 AD.  After he died, local citizens
    of the Poitou region and residents of Tours quarreled over where Martin would
    be buried. One evening, after dark, several residents of Tours carried Martins\u2019
    body to a waiting boat on the river Loire, where teams of rowers ferried his
    body on the river of Tours where masses of people waited on the riverbanks to
    meet and pay respects.  Shrines were created in his honor; the shrine chapel
    at Tours developed into one of the most prominent and influential establishments
    in medieval France. In later times the abbey was destroyed by fire on several
    occasions and ransacked by Norman Vikings in 853 and 903. It burned again in
    994 and was rebuilt in a 20 yearlong effort. In 1453 the remains of St Martin
    were transferred to a new reliquary."
